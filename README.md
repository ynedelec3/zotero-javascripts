# zotero-javascripts
A few scripts for use in Zotero javascripts panel : paste code in panel and run.

These scripts are for my personal use, results must be checked on a test library before final use.

1 update callnumber : empty callnumeber fields are replaced by record ID with custom prefix string (a few categories without callnumber field are excluded, there may be some others not included here).
